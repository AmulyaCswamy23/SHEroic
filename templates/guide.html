                    <ul class="list-disc p-4">
                        <li><h3>Menstural phase(day 1-5) : </h3>
                        <p>
                            This phase, which typically lasts from day one to day five, is the time when the lining of your uterus sheds through your vagina if pregnancy hasn’t occurred. Most people bleed for three to five days, but a period lasting only three days to as many as seven days is usually not a cause for worry.
                        </p></li>
    
                        <li><h3>Follicular phase (days 1-13) -</h3>
                            <p>
                                This phase typically takes place from days six to 14. During this time, the level of the hormone estrogen rises, which causes the lining of your uterus (the endometrium) to grow and thicken. In addition, another hormone — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) — causes follicles in your ovaries to grow. During days 10 to 14, one of the developing follicles will form a fully mature egg (ovum).
                            </p></li>
    
                            <li><h3>Ovulation phase (day 14) - </h3>
                                <p>
                                    This phase occurs roughly at about day 14 in a 28-day menstrual cycle. A sudden increase in another hormone — luteinizing hormone (LH) — causes your ovary to release its egg. This event is ovulation.
                                </p></li>
    
                                <li><h3>Luteal phase (day 15-28) -</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This phase lasts from about day 15 to day 28. Your egg leaves your ovary and begins to travel through your fallopian tubes to your uterus. The level of the hormone progesterone rises to help prepare your uterine lining for pregnancy. If the egg becomes fertilized by sperm and attaches itself to your uterine wall (implantation), you become pregnant. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop and the thick lining of your uterus sheds during your period.
                                    </p></li>
